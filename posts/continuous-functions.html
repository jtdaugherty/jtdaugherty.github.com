<h1>Continuous Functions</h1>
<span class="post-created">posted February 18, 2012</span>
<blockquote>
<p>In this post I'll explain some definitions and mechanics of continuous functions. I assume familiarity with function signature notation and related terminology such as domain, codomain, preimage, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Calculus we need to differentiate functions, but not all functions are <em>differentiable</em>. A function is differentiable if its derivative exists at every point in its domain. For example, <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> is differentiable everywhere in its domain <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> but the absolute value function <span class="math">\(\mbox{abs}(x) = |x|\)</span> is differentiable only at <span class="math">\(x \ne 0\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\mbox{abs}\)</span> is differentiable arbitrarily close to <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> on either side, but at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mbox{abs}\)</span> has a <em>cusp</em>, or a singular point with no neighboring points in the curve of the function. We can't decide what the slope of the derivative is at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\mbox{abs}\)</span> is not differentiable at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Cusps are one such example of situations in which a function is not differentiable; another example is a <em>break</em>. A break in a function is just what it sounds like: imagine drawing the graph of such a function, except that at the break point you have to lift your pencil and move elsewhere before resuming the graph.</p>
<p><img src="/generated-images/tikz-dffde24e2962342eaed7cd0fa27de84e3d458046.png" width="370" height="379" class="eq-right"></p>
<p>The graph of this function has two lines: a line approaching the <span class="math">\(y\)</span> axis from the left at <span class="math">\(y = -1\)</span> and a line starting at the <span class="math">\(y\)</span> axis going right at <span class="math">\(y = 1\)</span>. The break is at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If a function contains a &quot;break&quot;, we say it is <em>discontinuous</em>. It turns out that one of the requirements for differentiability is <em>continuity</em>. A continuous function is one which has a &quot;smooth&quot; curve at every point in its domain. One way to think about continuity is by looking at whether the function's graph has any breaks. But since we need a general way to test for continuity, we need something more practical and precise than drawing the graph of every function we want to test.</p>
<h2 id="sequences-and-limits">Sequences and Limits</h2>
<p>Another way to test for a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> for continuity at a point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is to ask, &quot;As inputs to <span class="math">\(f\)</span> <em>approach</em> <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, does the result <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> approach any particular value?&quot; We can express these inputs as a <em>sequence</em> <span class="math">\(\langle x_n \rangle = \langle x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle\)</span> and express the result as <span class="math">\(f\langle x_n \rangle\)</span>. This is essentially the <em>limit</em> concept; if the sequence has a limit, i.e., if it converges on a specific value, then perhaps the function is continuous at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>But this has a problem: limits must be tested from both the left and the right. A function's so-called &quot;left-hand&quot; limit might differ from its &quot;right-hand&quot; limit.</p>
<p>Take <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> as an example. If we were to compute the left-hand limit at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> with a sequence such as <span class="math">\(x_n = \langle -1.0, -0.5, -0.25, -0.0001, \ldots \rangle\)</span>, we'd see that the function appears constant, i.e., <span class="math">\(g\langle x_n \rangle = -1\)</span>. However, if we tested from the right with <span class="math">\(x_n = \langle 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0001, \ldots \rangle\)</span>, we'd see that <span class="math">\(g\langle x_n \rangle\)</span> clearly approaches <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. If both of these limits were equal, we could say that the function has a limit at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> and is differentiable there.</p>
<p>By now we might be convinced that any continuous function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> will approach the same limit from both the left and the right, but this does not <em>guarantee</em> that the function is continuous. Limits only describe the <em>potential</em> for the function to be defined at some <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Consider the function <span class="math">\(f(x) = 1/x\)</span>; no limit exists at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> since <span class="math">\(1/x\)</span> is not defined for <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-epsilon-delta-definition-of-continuity">The &quot;<span class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span>&quot; Definition of Continuity</h2>
<p>The idea behind using sequences and limits to think about continuity is the expectation that as inputs to a function get closer and closer to some value <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, so should the value of the function get closer and closer to <span class="math">\(f(a)\)</span>. While this may appear to be the case when looking at the limit behavior of the function to either side of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, we still need a way to guarantee that there are no &quot;gaps&quot; in the function.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;<span class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span>&quot; definition of continuity says that if a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, the values of the function are sufficiently close to <span class="math">\(f(a)\)</span> whenever the inputs are sufficiently close to <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. This is essentially a different way of stating what we have already said; formally, for any <span class="math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(|f(x)-f(a)| &lt; \epsilon\)</span>, there exists some <span class="math">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(|x - a| &lt; \delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Put another way, no matter how much we constrain the outputs of the function, there is a corresponding set of inputs we can map to those outputs. For example, what if we were to set <span class="math">\(\epsilon = 0.00000001\)</span>? This definition of continuity says that there is some &quot;margin&quot; of inputs around <span class="math">\(a\)</span> that map to this interval of <span class="math">\((f(a) - \epsilon, f(a) + \epsilon)\)</span>. If not, then the function is discontinuous at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider another contrived example:</p>
<p><img src="/generated-images/tikz-eab4dc7f1ec462aaab05e2706ec477cbb398cafe.png" width="370" height="365" class="eq-right"></p>
<p>You can see from the graph that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="math">\(x = 3\)</span>, but let's apply the test. Let <span class="math">\(\epsilon = 2\)</span>. For values of the function over the interval <span class="math">\((f(3) - 2, f(3) + 2)\)</span> we need to find some <span class="math">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(|x - 3| &lt; \delta\)</span>. Letting <span class="math">\(\delta = 1\)</span> is sufficient; the values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> over the interval <span class="math">\((f(3) - 2, f(3) + 2)\)</span> are <span class="math">\((2, 4)\)</span>, and the corresponding inputs are <span class="math">\((3 - \delta, 3 + \delta)\)</span> or <span class="math">\((2, 4)\)</span>. But let's try a smaller value for <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. Then the corresponding interval of interest is <span class="math">\((f(3) - \frac{1}{2}, f(3) + \frac{1}{2})\)</span> or <span class="math">\((3 \frac{1}{2}, 4 \frac{1}{2})\)</span>. Let's try <span class="math">\(\delta = 1\)</span> again. Then whenever <span class="math">\(|x - 3| &lt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(|f(x) - f(3)| &lt; \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. This means <span class="math">\(x\)</span> must be in the interval <span class="math">\((2, 4)\)</span>, but the corresponding values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> are <span class="math">\((f(2), f(4))\)</span> or <span class="math">\((2, 4)\)</span>; we have restricted the values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math">\((3 \frac{1}{2}, 4 \frac{1}{2})\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\delta = 1\)</span> will not work. We won't be able to find a value for <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> because the values of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> near <span class="math">\(a\)</span> are nowhere nearby!</p>
<p>Since the continuity definition states that we should be able to find a <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> for <em>any</em> <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> and we haven't been able to find one for <span class="math">\(\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>, we can conclude that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous. The key idea in this example is that the inability to find a matching <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> value for <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> indicates that the <em>trend</em> of the function is inconsistent. We would expect values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to be nearby <span class="math">\(f(a)\)</span> if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> were continuous, but the <span class="math">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span> method allows us to show that the inputs near <span class="math">\(a\)</span> result in values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that are nowhere close to <span class="math">\(f(a)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="open-sets">Open Sets</h2>
<p>The values of <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> mentioned above define the intervals on which the function is continuous; for example, <span class="math">\(|x - a| &lt; \delta\)</span> indicates that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous on the interval <span class="math">\((a - \delta, a + \delta)\)</span>, and similarly for the Y-axis interval <span class="math">\((f(a) - \epsilon, f(a) + \epsilon)\)</span>.</p>
<p>These intervals are <em>open</em> intervals; an open interval <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> is the set of points <span class="math">\(x\)</span> where <span class="math">\(a &lt; x &lt; b\)</span>. We contrast this with <em>closed</em> intervals such as <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> which include the points <span class="math">\(a \le x \le b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The epsilons and deltas in the preceding method are hard to deal with; the method asserts that such values exist, but to apply the method successfully we must find them. This requires successive laborious testing, and in some cases we may need to use extremely small values of <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> to show that no such <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> exists. In any case, an exhaustive search would be required. We need a better representation for this idea.</p>
<p>The open intervals described above are a specific case of a more general structure called an <em>open set</em>. A set <span class="math">\(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span> is <em>open</em> if for every <span class="math">\(x \in S\)</span> and some <span class="math">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> there is an open interval <span class="math">\((x - \delta, x + \delta)\)</span> contained in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. This says that for any point in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, there is a &quot;neighborhood&quot; of points around <span class="math">\(x\)</span> which are also in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>To see how this is possible, consider <span class="math">\(S = (1, 2)\)</span>. For values very close to <span class="math">\(1\)</span> there are always values even closer to <span class="math">\(1\)</span> that we can use to outline some &quot;breathing space&quot; around <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Take, for example, <span class="math">\(1.1\)</span>. Since we're dealing with real numbers it's easy to come up with a real number even closer to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, such as <span class="math">\(1.09\)</span>. We can use the difference (<span class="math">\(0.01\)</span>) to create an open interval around <span class="math">\(1.1\)</span>, <span class="math">\((1.1 - 0.01, 1.1 + 0.01)\)</span>. Using this technique it should be clear that this is possible for <em>any</em> <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in the interval <span class="math">\((1, 2)\)</span> because we are <em>excluding</em> the endpoints of the interval and we can always find points between the point of interest and one of the endpoints. In summary, the idea is that for any <span class="math">\(x\)</span> there must be <em>some</em> points around <span class="math">\(x\)</span> also contained in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. The value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> will usually depend on the value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>An equivalent expression of the <span class="math">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span> definition using open sets is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a function <span class="math">\(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> is continuous, then <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(S)\)</span> is open whenever <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is open.</p>
